# Task 6: Responsive Design Implementation

## Objective

This task focuses on implementing responsive design principles across the React
application to ensure optimal viewing and interaction experiences on various
devices, particularly mobile devices.

## Requirements

1. **Mobile-First Approach:**
   - Adopt a mobile-first approach, designing the layout and components for
     smaller screens first, and then progressively enhancing them for larger
     screens.

2. **Flexible Layouts:**
   - Use flexible layout techniques such as CSS Grid and Flexbox to create
     layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
   - Avoid fixed widths and heights where possible, opting for relative units
     (%, vw, vh) and responsive units (rem, em).

3. **Media Queries:**
   - Implement media queries to adjust styles based on screen size, orientation,
     and other device characteristics.
   - Use breakpoints that align with common device sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet,
     desktop).

4. **Responsive Images:**
   - Ensure images are responsive and do not overflow their containers.
   - Use techniques like `max-width: 100%` and `srcset` attributes for
     responsive images.

5. **Touch-Friendly Interactions:**
   - Ensure that all interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) are
     easily accessible and usable on touch devices.
   - Increase the size of touch targets where necessary.

6. **Testing:**
   - Test the application on various devices and screen sizes to ensure a
     consistent and user-friendly experience.
   - Use browser developer tools to simulate different devices and screen
     resolutions.

## Relevant Files

- `frontend/src/App.css`: Global styles for the application.
- `frontend/src/components/header/TopNav.jsx`: Header component.
- `frontend/src/components/header/MobileMenu.jsx`: Mobile menu component.
- `frontend/src/components/pages/Landing.jsx`: Landing page component.
- `frontend/src/components/matches/ViewMatches.jsx`: Component for viewing
  matches.
- `frontend/src/components/matches/MatchResult.jsx`: Component for displaying
  match results.
- `frontend/src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx`: Admin dashboard component.
- `frontend/src/components/admin/ManageMembers.jsx`: Component for managing
  members.
- `frontend/src/components/admin/ManageAdmins.jsx`: Component for managing
  admins.
- All other components that contain layout or styling.

## Task Breakdown

1. **Global Styles:**
   - Update `frontend/src/App.css` to include basic responsive styles, such as
     setting a default font size and using relative units.

2. **Header and Navigation:**
   - Modify `frontend/src/components/header/TopNav.jsx` and
     `frontend/src/components/header/MobileMenu.jsx` to create a responsive
     header and navigation menu.
   - Use a hamburger menu for smaller screens and a traditional navigation bar
     for larger screens.

3. **Page Layouts:**
   - Update the layout of `frontend/src/components/pages/Landing.jsx` and other
     page components to be responsive.
   - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to create flexible layouts that adapt to different
     screen sizes.

4. **Match Components:**
   - Ensure that `frontend/src/components/matches/ViewMatches.jsx` and
     `frontend/src/components/matches/MatchResult.jsx` are responsive and
     display correctly on mobile devices.

5. **Admin Components:**
   - Make `frontend/src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx`,
     `frontend/src/components/admin/ManageMembers.jsx`, and
     `frontend/src/components/admin/ManageAdmins.jsx` responsive.
   - Ensure that tables and forms are displayed correctly on smaller screens.

6. **Testing and Refinement:**
   - Test the application on various devices and screen sizes.
   - Make necessary adjustments to styles and layouts to ensure a consistent and
     user-friendly experience.

## Additional Notes

- Use browser developer tools to simulate different devices and screen
  resolutions.
- Pay attention to touch target sizes and ensure that interactive elements are
  easily accessible on touch devices.
- Use a consistent set of breakpoints throughout the application.
- Consider using a CSS framework or library (e.g., Material UI, Bootstrap) to
  simplify the implementation of responsive design.
